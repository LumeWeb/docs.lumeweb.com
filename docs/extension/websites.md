There are a few things to note before you start browsing. As stated before, this is an early demo. So here are a list of known problems:

* IPFS is highly hit/miss. It fails more often that it works and needs more love. IPNS which works with IPFS is generally even worse.
* Ethereum may have issues syncing. If this acts up or takes too long, try reloading the extension, re-installing the extension, or restarting Firefox. 

We have also mentioned that the extension is partially-centralized. Current it uses only one P2P node run by the project.

Now below are some example sites to try out:

* `mempooler` This is a normal server on Handshake
* `bafybeiguremy5hkphmhzqibnj4ftbursom5lhc52fxn3qaycj3kecy4ifi.ipfs.lume` This is a means of directly accessing an IPFS website
* `ens.eth` This one is highly likely to fail or just hang. Complex websites are not well-supported yet.

Note that due to ENS users mostly relying on IPNS, many ETH sites will not work well or at all right now.
