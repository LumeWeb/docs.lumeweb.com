The browser extension is currently Firefox only. Google has enforced security restrictions on Chrome/Chromium to make creating an all-in-one extension not feasible engineering-wise without compromising on decentralization. Simply put, Google's browser is more restrictive than any other.

You will need to install the extension at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lume-web/
