title: Browser Extension
---

Lume has been put into a browser extension as the first prototype product being created. This is an **extremely** early demo and many things are buggy and can break.

This extension has the goal of letting you browse decentralized (web3) websites, but doing so in an *actual* decentralized way. This means not using:

* AWS/Cloud for blockchain access
* Cloudflare/CDN's for application access
* ICANN (.com, .net, .org) for your website name

You will get your own Lume account that is a 12 word seed, which will create an anonymous account on web3portal.com.

The current networks supported are:

* Handshake (https://handshake.org)
* Ethereum (https://ethereum.org)
* IPFS (https://ipfs.io)
* Normal servers (accessing a VPS/Dedicated Server/Cloud server/Web host)

The current domain networks supported are:

* Handshake
* ENS
